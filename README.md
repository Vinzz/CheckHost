CheckHost
===========

I wrote this app in 2006 because my father's ISP sucked, and that he wanted to have stats about his connection status. So, on a given interval, this app will make a DNS request and log the result, along with basic stats in a txt or a csv file. Nothing fancy, but might be useful.

Rewrote it in 2015 to make it more user friendly.
